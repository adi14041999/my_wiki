<h1 id="central-limit-theorem">Central Limit Theorem</h1>
<h2 id="a-simplified-galton-board">A simplified Galton Board</h2>
<p>This is a Galton board. Maybe you've seen one before— it's a popular demonstration of how, even when a single event is chaotic and random with an effectively unknowable outcome, it's still possible to make precise statements about a large number of events, namely how the relative proportions for many different outcomes are distributed.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../galton_board.png" /></p>
<p>Let's take a model version of this. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../simplified.png" /></p>
<p>In this model, we will assume that each ball falls directly onto a certain central peg and that it has a 50-50 probability of bouncing to the left or to the right. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../central.png" /></p>
<p>We'll think of each of those outcomes as either adding one or subtracting one from its position. Once one of those is chosen, we make the highly unrealistic assumption that it happens to land dead center on the peg adjacent below it, where again it'll be faced with the same 50-50 choice of bouncing to the left or to the right.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb0.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../gb1.png" /></p>
<p>Here, there are five different rows of pegs, so the little hopping ball makes five different random choices between plus one and minus one. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb2.png" /></p>
<p>We can think of its final position as basically being the sum of all of those different numbers, which in this case happens to be one.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb3.png" /></p>
<p>We might label all of the different buckets with the sum that they represent. As we repeat this, we're looking at different possible sums for those five random numbers.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb4.png" /></p>
<p>Let it be emphasized that the goal right now is not to accurately model physics— the goal is to give a simple example to illustrate the central limit theorem. For that purpose, idealized though this might be, it actually provides a really good example.</p>
<p>If we let many different balls fall, making yet another unrealistic assumption that they don't influence each other (as if they're all ghosts), then the number of balls that fall into each different bucket gives us some loose sense for how likely each one of those buckets is.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb5.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../gb6.png" /></p>
<p>In this example, the numbers are simple enough that it's not too hard to explicitly calculate what the probability is for falling into each bucket. If you do want to think that through, you'll find it very reminiscent of Pascal's triangle.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb7.png" /></p>
<p>The basic idea of the central limit theorem is that if you increase the size of that sum (for example, here would mean increasing the number of rows of pegs for each ball to bounce off), then the distribution that describes where that sum is going to fall looks more and more like a bell curve.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gb8.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../gb9.png" /></p>
<h2 id="the-general-idea">The general idea</h2>
<p>It's actually worth taking a moment to write down that general idea. </p>
<p>The setup is that we have a random variable. We'll call that random number <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span>. What we're doing is taking multiple different samples of that variable <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> (or we could take different random variables that do the exact same thing, like <span class="arithmatex">\(X1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X2\)</span>,.. that are independent and are the exact same function, i.e., identical) and adding them all together. On our Galton board, that looks like letting the ball bounce off multiple different pegs on its way down to the bottom, and in the case of a die, you might imagine rolling many different dice and adding up the results. The claim of the central limit theorem is that as you let the size of that sum get bigger and bigger, then the distribution of that sum, how likely it is to fall into different possible values, will look more and more like a bell curve. That's it- that is the general idea.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../gen_idea.png" /></p>
<h2 id="dice-simulations">Dice simulations</h2>
<p>Usually if you think of rolling a die, you think of the six outcomes as being equally probable, but the theorem actually doesn't care about that. We could start with a weighted die, something with a non-trivial distribution across the outcomes, and the core idea still holds.</p>
<p>To better illustrate what the central limit theorem is all about, let's run four of these simulations in parallel, where on the upper left we're doing it where we're only adding two dice at a time, on the upper right we're doing it where we're adding five dice at a time, the lower left is the one that we just saw adding 10 dice at a time, and then we'll do another one with a bigger sum, 15 at a time.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../ds0.png" /></p>
<p>Notice how on the upper left when we're just adding two dice, the resulting distribution doesn't really look like a bell curve— it looks a lot more reminiscent of the one we started with, skewed towards the left. But as we allow for more and more dice in each sum, the resulting shape that comes up in these distributions looks more and more symmetric. It has the lump in the middle and fade towards the tails shape of a bell curve.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../ds1.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../ds2.png" /></p>
<p>And let it be emphasized again: you can start with any different distribution.</p>
<p>Illustrating things with a simulation like this is very fun, and it's kind of neat to see order emerge from chaos, but it also feels a little imprecise. How many samples do we need before we can be sure that what we're looking at is representative of the true distribution?</p>
<h2 id="the-true-distributions-for-sums">The true distributions for sums</h2>
<p>Let's get a little more theoretical and show the precise shape these distributions will take on in the long run. The easiest case to make this calculation is if we have a uniform distribution, where each possible face of the die has an equal probability, 1/6th.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds0.png" /></p>
<p>For example, if you then want to know how likely different sums are for a pair of dice, it's essentially a counting game, where you count up how many distinct pairs take on the same sum, which in the diagram drawn, you can conveniently think about by going through all the different diagonals. Since each such pair has an equal chance of showing up, 1 in 36, all you have to do is count the sizes of these buckets.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds1.png" /></p>
<p>That gives us a definitive shape for the distribution describing a sum of two dice, and if we were to play the same game with all possible triplets, the resulting distribution would look like this. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds2.png" /></p>
<p>Now what's more challenging, but a lot more interesting, is to ask what happens if we have a non-uniform distribution for that single die. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds3.png" /></p>
<p>So just to be crystal clear on what's being represented here: if you imagine sampling two different values from that top distribution, the one describing a single die, and adding them together, then the second distribution being drawn represents how likely you are to see various different sums (this is equivalent to the <a href="../convolution/">convolution</a> of the die's probability mass function with itself). Likewise, if you imagine sampling three distinct values from that top distribution, and adding them together, the next plot represents the probabilities for various different sums in that case. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds5.png" /></p>
<p>So if we compute what the distributions for these sums look like for larger and larger sums, it looks more and more like a bell curve.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds6.png" /></p>
<p>But before we get to that, let's make a couple of simple observations. For example, these distributions seem to be wandering to the right, and also they seem to be getting more spread out, and a little bit more flat. You cannot describe the central limit theorem quantitatively without taking into account both of those effects, which in turn requires describing the mean and the standard deviation.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../tds7.png" /></p>
<h2 id="mean-variance-and-standard-deviation">Mean, variance, and standard deviation</h2>
<p>Looking back at our sequence of distributions, let's talk about the mean and standard deviation. If we call the mean of the initial distribution mu, which for the one illustrated happens to be 2.24, hopefully it won't be too surprising if it's said that the mean of the next one is 2 times mu. That is, you roll a pair of dice, you want to know the expected value of the sum, it's two times the expected value for a single die. Similarly, the expected value for our sum of size 3 is 3 times mu, and so on and so forth. The mean just marches steadily on to the right, which is why our distributions seem to be drifting off in that direction.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../msd0.png" /></p>
<p>A little more challenging, but very important, is to describe how the standard deviation changes. The key fact here is that if you have two different random variables, then the variance for the sum of those variables is the same as just adding together the original two variances. The main thing to highlight is how it's the variance that adds— it's not the standard deviation that adds. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../msd1.png" /></p>
<p>So, critically, if you were to take n different realizations of the same random variable and ask what the sum looks like, the variance of sum is n times the variance of your original variable, meaning the standard deviation, the square root of all this, is the square root of n times the original standard deviation.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../msd2.png" /></p>
<p>For example, back in our sequence of distributions, if we label the standard deviation of our initial one with sigma, then the next standard deviation is going to be the square root of 2 times sigma, and after that it looks like the square root of 3 times sigma, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../msd3.png" /></p>
<p>This, as mentioned, is very important. It means that even though our distributions are getting spread out, they're not spreading out all that quickly— they only do so in proportion to the square root of the size of the sum.</p>
<p>As we prepare to make a more quantitative description of the central limit theorem, the core intuition to keep in your head is that we'll basically realign all of these distributions so that their means line up together, and then rescale them so that all of the standard deviations are just going to be equal to one. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../msd4.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../msd5.png" /></p>
<p>And when we do that, the shape that results gets closer and closer to a certain universal shape, described with an elegant little function that we'll unpack in just a moment.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../msd6.png" /></p>
<p>And let it be said one more time: the real magic here is how we could have started with any distribution, describing a single roll of the die, and if we play the same game, considering what the distributions for the many different sums look like, and we realign them so that the means line up, and we rescale them so that the standard deviations are all one, we still approach that same universal shape, which is kind of mind-boggling.</p>
<h2 id="unpacking-the-gaussian-formula">Unpacking the Gaussian formula</h2>
<p>The function e to the x, or anything to the x, describes exponential growth, and if you make that exponent negative, which flips around the graph horizontally, you might think of it as describing exponential decay. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g0.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g1.png" /></p>
<p>To make this decay in both directions, you could do something to make sure the exponent is always negative and growing, like taking the negative absolute value. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g2.png" /></p>
<p>That would give us this kind of awkward sharp point in the middle, but if instead you make that exponent the negative square of x, you get a smoother version of the same thing, which decays in both directions.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g3.png" /></p>
<p>This gives us the basic bell curve shape. Now if you throw a constant in front of that x, and you scale that constant up and down, it lets you stretch and squish the graph horizontally, allowing you to describe narrow and wider bell curves.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g4.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g5.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g6.png" /></p>
<p>And a quick thing to point out here is that based on the rules of exponentiation, as we tweak around that constant c, you could also think about it as simply changing the base of the exponentiation.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g7.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g8.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g9.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g10.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g11.png" /></p>
<p>And in that sense, the number e is not really all that special for our formula. We could replace it with any other positive constant, and you'll get the same family of curves as we tweak that constant. Make it a 2, same family of curves. Make it a 3, same family of curves. The reason we use e is that it gives that constant a very readable meaning.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g12.png" /></p>
<p>Or rather, if we reconfigure things a little bit so that the exponent looks like negative 1/2 times x divided by a certain constant, which we'll suggestively call sigma squared, then once we turn this into a probability distribution, that constant sigma will be the standard deviation of that distribution. And that's very nice.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g13.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g14.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g16.png" /></p>
<p>But before we can interpret this as a probability distribution, we need the area under the curve to be 1.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g17.png" /></p>
<p>As it stands with the basic bell curve shape of e to the negative x squared, the area is not 1, it's actually the square root of pi.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g18.png" /></p>
<p>For our purposes right now, all it means is that we should divide this function by the square root of pi, and it gives us the area we want. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g19.png" /></p>
<p>Throwing back in the constants we had earlier, the one half and the sigma, the effect there is to stretch out the graph by a factor of sigma times the square root of 2. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g20.png" /></p>
<p>So we also need to divide out by that in order to make sure it has an area of 1, and combining those fractions, the factor out front looks like 1 divided by sigma times the square root of 2 pi.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g21.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g22.png" /></p>
<p>This, finally, is a valid probability distribution. As we tweak that value sigma, resulting in narrower and wider curves, that constant in the front always guarantees that the area equals 1. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g23.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g24.png" /></p>
<p>The special case where sigma equals 1 has a specific name— we call it the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g25.png" /></p>
<p>And all possible normal distributions are not only parameterized with this value sigma, but we also subtract off another constant mu from the variable x, and this essentially just lets you slide the graph left and right so that you can prescribe the mean of this distribution. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g26.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g27.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g28.png" /></p>
<p>So in short, we have two parameters, one describing the mean, one describing the standard deviation, and they're all tied together in this big formula involving an e and a pi.</p>
<p>Let's look back again at the idea of starting with some random variable and asking what the distributions for sums of that variable look like. When you increase the size of that sum, the resulting distribution will shift according to a growing mean, and it slowly spreads out according to a growing standard deviation. </p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g29.png" /></p>
<p>And putting some actual formulas to it, if we know the mean of our underlying random variable, we call it mu, and we also know its standard deviation, and we call it sigma, then the mean for the sum on the bottom will be mu times the size of the sum, and the standard deviation will be sigma times the square root of that size.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g30.png" /></p>
<p>So now, if we want to claim that this looks more and more like a bell curve, and a bell curve is only described by two different parameters, the mean and the standard deviation, you know what to do. You could plug those two values into the formula, and it gives you a highly explicit, albeit kind of complicated, formula for a curve that should closely fit our distribution.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="../g31.png" />
<img alt="img" src="../g32.png" /></p>
<h2 id="the-more-elegant-formulation">The more elegant formulation</h2>
<p>But there's another way we can describe it that's a little more elegant and lends itself to a very fun visual that we can build up to. Instead of focusing on the sum of all of these random variables, let's modify this expression a little bit, where what we'll do is we'll look at the mean that we expect that sum to take, and we subtract it off so that our new expression has a mean of zero, and then we're going to look at the standard deviation we expect of our sum, and divide out by that, which basically just rescales the units so that the standard deviation of our expression will equal one.</p>
<p>This might seem like a more complicated expression, but it actually has a highly readable meaning. It's essentially saying how many standard deviations away from the mean is this sum? For example, this bar here corresponds to a certain value that you might find when you roll 10 dice and you add them all up, and its position a little above negative one is telling you that that value is a little bit less than one standard deviation lower than the mean.</p>
<p>Also, by the way, in anticipation for the animation being built to here, the way things are being represented on that lower plot is that the area of each one of these bars is telling us the probability of the corresponding value rather than the height. You might think of the y-axis as representing not probability but a kind of probability density. The reason for this is to set the stage so that it aligns with the way we interpret continuous distributions, where the probability of falling between a range of values is equal to an area under a curve between those values. In particular, the area of all the bars together is going to be one.</p>
<p>Now, with all of that in place, let's have a little fun. Let's start by rolling things back so that the distribution on the bottom represents a relatively small sum, like adding together only three such random variables. Notice what happens as the distribution we start with changes. As it changes, the distribution on the bottom completely changes its shape. It's very dependent on what we started with.</p>
<p>If we let the size of our sum get a little bit bigger, say going up to 10, and as the distribution for x changes, it largely stays looking like a bell curve, but some distributions can be found that get it to change shape. For example, the really lopsided one where almost all the probability is in the numbers 1 or 6 results in this kind of spiky bell curve. And if you'll recall, earlier on this was actually shown in the form of a simulation. Though if you were wondering whether that spikiness was an artifact of the randomness or reflected the true distribution, it turns out it reflects the true distribution. In this case, 10 is not a large enough sum for the central limit theorem to kick in.</p>
<p>But if instead we let that sum grow and consider adding 50 different values, which is actually not that big, then no matter how the distribution for our underlying random variable changes, it has essentially no effect on the shape of the plot on the bottom. No matter where we start, all of the information and nuance for the distribution of x gets washed away, and we tend towards this single universal shape described by a very elegant function for the standard normal distribution: 1 over square root of 2 pi times e to the negative x squared over 2.</p>
<p>This, this right here is what the central limit theorem is all about. Almost nothing you can do to this initial distribution changes the shape we tend towards.</p>
<p>Now, the more theoretically minded among you might still be wondering what is the actual theorem, like what's the mathematical statement that could be proved or disproved that we're claiming here. If you want a nice formal statement, here's how it might go.</p>
<p>Consider this value where we're summing up n different instantiations of our variable, but tweaked and tuned so that its mean and standard deviation are 1, again meaning you can read it as asking how many standard deviations away from the mean is the sum. Then the actual rigorous no-jokes-this-time statement of the central limit theorem is that if you consider the probability that this value falls between two given real numbers, a and b, and you consider the limit of that probability as the size of your sum goes to infinity, then that limit is equal to a certain integral, which basically describes the area under a standard normal distribution between those two values.</p>
<p>Again, there are three underlying assumptions that have yet to be told, but other than those, in all of its gory detail, this right here is the central limit theorem.</p>
<h2 id="a-concrete-example">A concrete example</h2>
<p>All of that is a bit theoretical, so it might be helpful to bring things back down to earth and turn back to the concrete example that was mentioned at the start, where you imagine rolling a die 100 times, and let's assume it's a fair die for this example, and you add together the results. The challenge is to find a range of values such that you're 95% sure that the sum will fall within this range.</p>
<p>For questions like this, there's a handy rule of thumb about normal distributions, which is that about 68% of your values are going to fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of your values, the thing we care about, fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and a whopping 99.7% of your values will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. It's a rule of thumb that's commonly memorized by people who do a lot of probability and stats.</p>
<p>Naturally, this gives us what we need for our example, and let's go ahead and draw out what this would look like, where the distribution for a fair die is shown up at the top, and the distribution for a sum of 100 such dice on the bottom, which by now as you know looks like a certain normal distribution.</p>
<p>Step 1 with a problem like this is to find the mean of your initial distribution, which in this case will look like 1/6th times 1 plus 1/6th times 2 on and on and on, and works out to be 3.5. We also need the standard deviation, which requires calculating the variance, which as you know involves adding all the squares of the differences between the values and the means, and it works out to be 2.92, square root of that comes out to be 1.71.</p>
<p>Those are the only two numbers we need, and you are invited again to reflect on how magical it is that those are the only two numbers you need to completely understand the bottom distribution. Its mean will be 100 times mu, which is 350, and its standard deviation will be the square root of 100 times sigma, so 10 times sigma, 17.1.</p>
<p>Remembering our handy rule of thumb, we're looking for values two standard deviations away from the mean, and when you subtract 2 sigma from mean, you end up with about 316, and when you add 2 sigma you end up with 384. There you go, that gives us the answer.</p>
<p>Instead of just asking about the sum of 100 die rolls, let's say we had you divide that number by 100, which basically means all the numbers in our diagram in the bottom get divided by 100. Take a moment to interpret what this all would be saying then. The expression essentially tells you the empirical average for 100 different die rolls, and that interval we found is now telling you what range you are expecting to see for that empirical average.</p>
<p>In other words, you might expect it to be around 3.5, that's the expected value for a die roll, but what's much less obvious and what the central limit theorem lets you compute is how close to that expected value you'll reasonably find yourself. In particular, it's worth your time to take a moment mulling over what the standard deviation for this empirical average is, and what happens to it as you look at a bigger and bigger sample of die rolls.</p>
<h2 id="underlying-assumptions">Underlying assumptions</h2>
<p>Lastly, but probably most importantly, let's talk about the assumptions that go into this theorem. The first one is that all of these variables that we're adding up are independent from each other. The outcome of one process doesn't influence the outcome of any other process.</p>
<p>The second is that all of these variables are drawn from the same distribution. Both of these have been implicitly assumed with our dice example. We've been treating the outcome of each die roll as independent from the outcome of all the others, and we're assuming that each die follows the same distribution. Sometimes in the literature you'll see these two assumptions lumped together under the initials IID for independent and identically distributed.</p>
<p>One situation where these assumptions are decidedly not true would be the Galton board. Think about it. Is it the case that the way a ball bounces off of one of the pegs is independent from how it's going to bounce off the next peg? Absolutely not. Depending on the last bounce, it's coming in with a completely different trajectory. And is it the case that the distribution of possible outcomes off of each peg are the same for each peg that it hits? Again, almost certainly not.</p>
<p>Maybe it hits one peg glancing to the left, meaning the outcomes are hugely skewed in that direction, and then hits the next one glancing to the right. When all those simplifying assumptions were made in the opening example, it wasn't just to make this easier to think about. It's also that those assumptions were necessary for this to actually be an example of the central limit theorem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems to be true that for the real Galton board, despite violating both of these, a normal distribution does kind of come about? Part of the reason might be that there are generalizations of the theorem beyond the scope of this video that relax these assumptions, especially the second one. But there is a caution against the fact that many times people seem to assume that a variable is normally distributed, even when there's no actual justification to do so.</p>
<p>The third assumption is actually fairly subtle. It's that the variance we've been computing for these variables is finite. This was never an issue for the dice example because there were only six possible outcomes. But in certain situations where you have an infinite set of outcomes, when you go to compute the variance, the sum ends up diverging off to infinity. These can be perfectly valid probability distributions, and they do come up in practice.</p>
<p>But in those situations, as you consider adding many different instantiations of that variable and letting that sum approach infinity, even if the first two assumptions hold, it is very much a possibility that the thing you tend towards is not actually a normal distribution.</p>
