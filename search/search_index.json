The term autoregressive originates from the literature on time-series models where observations from the previous time-steps are used to predict the value at the current time step. Here, we fix an ordering of the variables x1, x2, \u2026, xn and the distribution for the i-th random variable depends on the values of all the preceding random variables in the chosen ordering x1, x2, \u2026, xi\u22121.</p> <p>If we allow for every conditional p(xi|x&lt;i) to be specified in a tabular form, then such a representation is fully general and can represent any possible distribution over n random variables. However, the space complexity for such a representation grows exponentially with n.</p> <p>To see why, let us consider the conditional for the last dimension, given by p(xn|x&lt;n). In order to fully specify this conditional, we need to specify a probability for 2^(n\u22121) configurations of the variables x1, x2, \u2026, xn\u22121. Since the probabilities should sum to 1, the total number of parameters for specifying this conditional is given by 2^(n\u22121)\u22121. Hence, a tabular representation for the conditionals is impractical for learning the joint distribution factorized via chain rule.</p> <p>In an autoregressive generative model, the conditionals are specified as parameterized functions with a fixed number of parameters. Specifically, we assume that each conditional distribution corresponds to a Bernoulli random variable. We then learn a function that maps the preceding random variables to the parameter (mean) of this Bernoulli distribution. Hence, we have:</p> \\[ p_{\\theta_i}(x_i \\mid x_{&lt;i}) = \\text{Bern} \\left( f_i(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{i-1}) \\right) \\] <p>where the function is defined as:</p> \\[ f_i : \\{0,1\\}^{i-1} \\to [0,1] \\] <p>and theta_i denotes the set of parameters used to specify this function. This function takes in a vector of size (i-1) where each element is a 0 or a 1, and outputs a scalar bit.</p> <p>The total number of parameters in an autoregressive generative model is given by:</p> \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left| \\theta_i \\right| \\] <p>In the simplest case, we can specify the function as a linear combination of the input elements followed by a sigmoid non-linearity (to restrict the output to lie between 0 and 1). This gives us the formulation of a fully-visible sigmoid belief network (FVSBN).</p> \\[ f_i(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{i-1}) = \\sigma(\\alpha^{(i)}_0 + \\alpha^{(i)}_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\alpha^{(i)}_{i-1} x_{i-1}) \\] <p>where \\(\\sigma\\) denotes the sigmoid function and \\(\\theta_i = \\{\\alpha^{(i)}_0, \\alpha^{(i)}_1, \\dots, \\alpha^{(i)}_{i-1}\\}\\) denote the parameters of the mean function. The conditional for variable \\(i\\) requires \\(i\\) parameters, and hence the total number of parameters in the model is given by \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n i = O(n^2)\\). Note that the number of parameters are much fewer than the exponential complexity of the tabular case.</p> <p>A natural way to increase the expressiveness of an autoregressive generative model is to use more flexible parameterizations for the mean function e.g., multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). For example, consider the case of a neural network with 1 hidden layer. The mean function for variable \\(i\\) can be expressed as</p> \\[ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{h}_i &amp;= \\sigma(\\mathbf{A}_i \\mathbf{x}_{&lt;i} + \\mathbf{c}_i) \\\\ f_i(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{i-1}) &amp;= \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i)} \\mathbf{h}_i + b_i) \\end{align} \\] <p>where \\(\\mathbf{h}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) denotes the hidden layer activations for the MLP and \\(\\theta_i = \\{\\mathbf{A}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times (i-1)}, \\mathbf{c}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\) are the set of parameters for the mean function \\(\\mu_i(\\cdot)\\). The total number of parameters in this model is dominated by the matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}_i\\) and given by \\(O(n^2d)\\).</p> <p>Note: The term \"mean function\" here refers to the function that determines the mean (expected value) of the Bernoulli distribution for each variable. Since we're modeling binary variables, the mean of the Bernoulli distribution is the probability of the variable being 1. The sigmoid function \\(\\sigma\\) ensures that this probability lies between 0 and 1.</p> <p>For a Bernoulli random variable \\(X\\) with parameter \\(p\\), the expectation (mean) is given by:</p> \\[ \\mathbb{E}[X] = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p \\] <p>This is because: - \\(X\\) takes value 1 with probability \\(p\\) - \\(X\\) takes value 0 with probability \\((1-p)\\) - The expectation is the weighted sum of all possible values, where the weights are their respective probabilities</p> <p>Therefore, when we say the mean function determines the mean of the Bernoulli distribution, we're saying it determines the probability \\(p\\) of the variable being 1.</p> <p>The Neural Autoregressive Density Estimator (NADE) provides an alternate MLP-based parameterization that is more statistically and computationally efficient than the vanilla approach. In NADE, parameters are shared across the functions used for evaluating the conditionals. In particular, the hidden layer activations are specified as</p> \\[ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{h}_i &amp;= \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{.,&lt;i} \\mathbf{x}_{&lt;i} + \\mathbf{c}) \\\\ f_i(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{i-1}) &amp;= \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i)} \\mathbf{h}_i + b_i) \\end{align} \\] <p>where \\(\\theta = \\{\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}, \\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, \\{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\}_{i=1}^n, \\{b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}_{i=1}^n\\}\\) is the full set of parameters for the mean functions \\(f_1(\\cdot), f_2(\\cdot), \\dots, f_n(\\cdot)\\). The weight matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) and the bias vector \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) are shared across the conditionals.

Here, the conditionals are modeled via a continuous distribution such as a equi-weighted mixture of \\(K\\) Gaussians. Instead of learning a mean function, we now learn the means \\(\\mu_{i,1}, \\mu_{i,2}, \\dots, \\mu_{i,K}\\) and variances \\(\\Sigma_{i,1}, \\Sigma_{i,2}, \\dots, \\Sigma_{i,K}\\) of the \\(K\\) Gaussians for every conditional. For statistical and computational efficiency, a single function \\(g_i: \\mathbb{R}^{i-1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2K}\\) outputs all the means and variances of the \\(K\\) Gaussians for the \\(i\\)-th conditional distribution.</p> <p>The conditional distribution \\(p_{\\theta_i}(x_i \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{&lt;i})\\) in RNADE is given by:</p> \\[ p_{\\theta_i}(x_i \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{&lt;i}) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=1}^K \\mathcal{N}(x_i; \\mu_{i,k}, \\Sigma_{i,k}) \\] <p>where \\(\\mathcal{N}(x; \\mu, \\Sigma)\\) denotes the probability density of a Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\Sigma\\) evaluated at \\(x\\). The parameters \\(\\{\\mu_{i,k}, \\Sigma_{i,k}\\}_{k=1}^K\\) are the outputs of the function \\(g_i(\\mathbf{x}_{&lt;i})\\).</p> <p>This is how RNADE is autoregressive. Example sequence showing autoregressive dependencies:</p> <p>\\(x_1\\):    - Input to \\(g_1\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}_{&lt;1} = []\\) (empty)   - Output: \\(\\{\\mu_{1,k}, \\Sigma_{1,k}\\}_{k=1}^K\\) for \\(p(x_1)\\)</p> <p>\\(x_2\\):    - Input to \\(g_2\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}_{&lt;2} = [x_1]\\)   - Output: \\(\\{\\mu_{2,k}, \\Sigma_{2,k}\\}_{k=1}^K\\) for \\(p(x_2 \\mid x_1)\\)</p> <p>\\(x_3\\):    - Input to \\(g_3\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}_{&lt;3} = [x_1, x_2]\\)   - Output: \\(\\{\\mu_{3,k}, \\Sigma_{3,k}\\}_{k=1}^K\\) for \\(p(x_3 \\mid x_1, x_2)\\)</p> <p>\\(x_4\\):    - Input to \\(g_4\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}_{&lt;4} = [x_1, x_2, x_3]\\)   - Output: \\(\\{\\mu_{4,k}, \\Sigma_{4,k}\\}_{k=1}^K\\) for \\(p(x_4 \\mid x_1, x_2, x_3)\\)</p> <p>This sequential, conditional generation process is what makes RNADE an autoregressive model. The mixture of Gaussians is just the form of the conditional distribution, but the autoregressive property comes from how these distributions are parameterized based on previous variables.</p>"},{"location":"AI/deep_generative_models/autoregressive_models/#learning-and-inference","title":"Learning and inference","text":"<p>Recall that learning a generative model involves optimizing the closeness between the data and model distributions.

The key insight is that we're using random sampling to approximate the intractable integral, trading exact computation for statistical estimation.</p> <p>Rather than maximizing the log-likelihood directly, an alternate is to instead construct a lower bound that is more amenable to optimization. To do so, we note that evaluating the marginal likelihood \\(p(x)\\) is at least as difficult as as evaluating the posterior \\(p(z|x)\\) for any latent vector \\(z\\) since by definition \\(p(z|x) = p(x,z)/p(x)\\).</p> <p>Next, we introduce a variational family \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) of distributions that approximate the true, but intractable posterior \\(p(z|x)\\).
