# Phase 1: Learning
More research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when learning, it's critical to prioritize topic selection.

**Foundational Machine Learning Skills**
For example, it’s important to understand models such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts behind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, optimization algorithms, and error analysis.

**Deep learning**
This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel in the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, practical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, sequence models, and transformers.

**Math relevant to machine learning**
Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various manipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes’ rule, and hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA)— using visualizations and other methods to systematically explore a dataset— is an underrated skill. Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. The math needed to do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, improved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural network architectures without doing any calculus.

**Software development** 
While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine learning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software to implement complex AI systems.

A good course— in which a body of material has been organized into a coherent and logical form— is often the most time-efficient way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. When you’ve absorbed the knowledge available in courses, you can switch over to research papers and other resources.

Given how quickly our field is changing, there’s little choice but to keep learning if you want to keep up. If you can cultivate the habit of learning a little bit every week, you can make significant progress with what feels like less effort.

The best way to build a new habit is to start small and succeed, rather than start too big and fail.
