# Phase 3: Job

## A Simple Framework for Starting Your AI Job Search

Are you switching roles? For example, if you’re a software engineer, university student, or physicist who’s looking to become a machine learning engineer, that’s a role switch. Are you switching industries? For example, if you work for a healthcare company, financial services company, or a government agency and want to work for a software company, that’s a switch in industries. If you’re looking for your first job in AI, you’ll probably find switching either roles or industries easier than doing both at the same time.

If you’re considering a role switch, a startup can be an easier place to do it than a big company. While there are exceptions, startups usually don’t have enough people to do all the desired work. If you’re able to help with AI tasks— even if it’s not your official job — your work is likely to be appreciated. This lays the groundwork for a possible role switch without needing to leave the company. In contrast, in a big company, a rigid reward system is more likely to reward you for doing your job well (and your manager for supporting you in doing the job for which you were hired), but it’s not as likely to reward contributions outside your job’s scope.

## Using Informational Interviews to Find the Right Job

An informational interview involves finding someone in a company or role you’d like to know more about and informally interviewing them about their work. Such conversations are separate from searching for a job. In fact, it’s helpful to interview people who hold positions that align with your interests well before you’re ready to kick off a job search.

Finding someone to interview isn’t always easy, but many people who are in senior positions today received help when they were new from those who had entered the field ahead of them, and many are eager to pay it forward.

## Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

AI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is easy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you’ve succeeded at sucking at AI— congratulations, you’re on your way! It is guaranteed that everyone who has published a seminal AI paper struggled with simple technical challenges at some point.

No one is an expert at everything! Recognize what you do well.
