# Make Every Day Count

We could expect to live a total of 27,649 days. How small this number is! Print it in a large font and paste it somewhere as a daily reminder. That’s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, build for the future, and help others. Whatever you’re doing today, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?
