# Phase 2: Projects

## Scoping Successful AI Projects

One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth working on.

Here are five steps to help you scope projects.

**Step 1: Identify a business problem (not an AI problem).**

Find a domain expert and ask, "What are the top three things that you wish worked better? Why aren't they working yet?"

For example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you might discover that power-grid operators can't accurately predict how much power intermittent sources like wind and solar might generate in the future.

**Step 2: Brainstorm AI solutions.**

Don't execute on the first idea you get excited about. Sometimes this works out okay, but sometimes you end up missing an even better idea that might not have taken any more effort to build.

Once you understand a problem, you can brainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, to predict power generation from intermittent sources, we might consider:

- Using satellite imagery to map the locations of wind turbines more accurately

- Using satellite imagery to estimate the height and generation capacity of wind turbines  

- Using weather data to better predict cloud cover and thus solar irradiance

Sometimes there isn't a good AI solution, and that's okay too.

**Step 3: Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions.**

You can determine whether an approach is technically feasible by looking at:

- Published work

- What competitors have done

- Building a quick proof of concept implementation

You can determine its value by consulting with domain experts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the potential solutions mentioned above).

**Step 4: Determine milestones.**

Once you've deemed a project sufficiently valuable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This includes both **Machine learning metrics** (such as accuracy) and **Business metrics** (such as revenue).

Unfortunately, not every business problem can be reduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren't able to determine reasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more about the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the missing perspective.

**Step 5: Budget for resources.**

Think through everything you'll need to get the project done including:

- **Data**: Raw data, labeled data, data cleaning tools

- **Personnel**: Team members, skills required, roles and responsibilities

- **Time**: Project timeline, milestones, deadlines

- **Integrations**: APIs, third-party services, system connections

- **Support**: Other teams, external vendors, domain experts

For example, if you need funds to purchase satellite imagery, make sure that's in the budget.

**Note:** Working on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is infeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding.

## Finding Projects that Complement Your Career Goals

A fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact over time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to bigger projects as your skills grow.

### What if you don't have any project ideas?

Here are a few ways to generate them:

**Join existing projects.** If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.

**Keep reading and talking to people.** You can come up with new ideas whenever you spend a lot of time reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts.

**Focus on an application area.** Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology — say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of applications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast!

**Develop a side hustle.** Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not develop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators. Silicon Valley abounds with stories of startups that started as side projects.

### Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into?

Here's a quick checklist of factors to consider:

**Will the project help you grow technically?** Ideally, it should be challenging enough to stretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you on a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.

**Do you have good teammates to work with?** If not, are there people you can discuss things with? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge impact on your growth.

**Can it be a stepping stone?** If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/or business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? If the project is bigger than those you've worked on before, there's a good chance it could be such a stepping stone.

Building models is an iterative process. For many applications, the cost of training and conducting error analysis is not prohibitive. Furthermore, it is very difficult to carry out a study that will shed light on the appropriate model, data, and hyperparameters. So it makes sense to build an end-to-end system quickly and revise it until it works well.

But when committing to a direction means making a costly investment or entering a one-way door (meaning a decision that's hard to reverse), it's often worth spending more time in advance to make sure it really is a good idea.

## Building a Portfolio of Projects that Shows Skill Progression

Over the course of a career, you’re likely to work on projects in succession, each growing in scope and complexity. Each project is only one step on a longer journey, hopefully one that has a positive impact. Don’t worry about starting too small. Communication is key. You need to be able to explain your thinking if you want others to see the value in your work and trust you with resources that you can invest in larger projects. Leadership isn’t just for managers. When you reach the point of working on larger AI projects that require teamwork, your ability to lead projects will become more important, whether or not you are in a formal position of leadership.

Building a portfolio of projects, especially one that shows progress over time from simple to complex undertakings, will be a big help when it comes to looking for a job.
