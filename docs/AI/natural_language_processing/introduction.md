# Introduction

ML is a subfield of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data, allowing them to make predictions or decisions without those being explicitly programmed. ML is driving advancements in so many different fields, such as computer vision, voice recognition, and, of course, NLP. 

NLP is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves using computational techniques to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it possible for computers to understand and respond to human input naturally and meaningfully. 

With all the (impressive!) advances in NLP in the last decades, we are still nowhere close to developing learning machines that have a fraction of acquisition ability of children.

Here are a few of the major applications of NLP, not to be exhaustive.

Machine Translation. Perhaps one of the earliest and most successful applications and driving uses of natural language processing, MT systems learn to translate between languages and are ubiquitous in the digital world.

Question answering and information retrieval. In NLP, question answering has tended to be related to information-seeking questions (“Who is the emir of Abu Dhabi?”, “What is the process by which I can get an intern visa for the United Kingdom?”). Continually broadening the scope of answerable questions, providing provenance for answers, answering questions in an interactive dialogue- this is one of the fastest-evolving research directions.

Summarization and analysis of text. Companies want to do market research, politicians want to know peoples’ opinions, individuals want summaries of complex topics in digestible form.

One of the most significant advances in NLP has been the development of pre-trained language models, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs) and generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). These models have been trained on massive amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or language translation.
